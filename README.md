# Automate Ableton Collect and Save

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of collecting and saving samples in Ableton Live projects. By running this script, you can easily move your Ableton Live projects to another computer or storage device without losing any samples.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [pylive](https://github.com/ideoforms/pylive) library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/DavidC6473/Automate-Ableton-Collect-And-Save.git

2. Change to the project directory:
cd Automate-Ableton-Collect-And-Save

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install pylive

## Usage

1. Ensure that Ableton Live is installed on your machine.

2. Open the Ableton Live project for which you want to collect and save the samples.

3. In the project folder, locate the `collect_and_save_automation.py` file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

5. Run the following command to execute the script:
python collect_and_save_automation.py

6. The script will automatically collect and save all the samples used in the Ableton Live project, ensuring they are stored within the project folder.

7. Once the script finishes, you can safely move the entire project folder to another computer or storage device without losing any samples.
